<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes from version 0.7 to
version 1.0.1</h3>
&nbsp;
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
1) New type of move proposed in MCMC algorithm embedded in mcmcFmodel<br>
Now makes joint updates of c and f, instead of separate block updates<br>
of c and f.<br>
It&nbsp; improves mixing of the chain and avoids (or at least enhance
w.r.t) troubles with ghost populations;<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Function simFmodel no longer makes use of argument nloc (numer of
loci). It was obviously redundant with argument allele.number and now
nloc is evaluated inside simFmodel by nloc=lengh(allele.number)<br>
<br>
<br>
3) Update of the number of population (subroutines bdclass7) slightly
corrected in order to process populations whatever the number of tiles
or individuals they currently contain. This is implemented in fortran
subroutines bdclass8 and bdclass8bis.<br>
<br>
<br>
4) All computations now carried out in double precision<br>
<br>
<br>
5) Now use the R random number generators (via the C wrapper).<br>
<br>
<br>
6) Function FormatGenotypes is now automatically called by function
mcmcFmodel. <br>
<br>
<br>
7) Use R function sample instead of my function rdiscr<br>
<br>
<br>
8) Handle haploid datasets: haploid data are first ploidized in
function mcmcFmodel all computations are identical to the diploid case
except the evaluation of the likelihood for which the squared root is
taken. Function mcmcFmodel requires now an extra argument 'ploidy' ste
to 2 (diploid) by default. <br>
