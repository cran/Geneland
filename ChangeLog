	Changes from version 2.0.9 to version 2.0.10:
	--------------------------------------------

* R

- Function PlotFreq 
	. first instruction allele.numbers <- as.matrix(allele.numbers) removed

- Function simdata 
	the coordinates are now returned as a n x 2 matrix instead of a 2 x n matrix
	(to be consistent with simFmodel and mcmcFmodel)

- Function mcmcFmodel
	. stop() instruction if nb.nuclei.max < nindiv when SPATIAL=FALSE

	. Now an extra argument filter.null.allelles set to TRUE by default.
	  This option is not programmed for freq.model="Falush" (with argument check)
          If filter.null.allelles IS TRUE an extra allele is created at each locus
          It's frequency can plotted with PlotFreq
