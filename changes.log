Changes from version 0.6 to version 0.7:
----------------------------------------

        --    NO SYNTAXIC CHANGE  -- 

* Function simFmodel now returns a list containing element color.nuclei

* call of X11() in functions simfmodel, Plot* and PosteriorMode replaced by
  get(getOption("device"))() 

* Documentation of PostProcessChain do not refer any longer to
  path.data (which no longer exists since version 0.6)

* Array ptemp now passed as argument in subroutine 
rpriof and rpriorfa in Fortran

* PostProcessChain passes matrix t(coordinates) instead of
  coordinates

* Function PlotTesselation and PosteriorMode uses directly coordinates instead of
  using this useless matrix s 

* Documentation of PostProcessChain() now explains correctly  the
storage format of images (column wise instead of row wise).

* Example code in mcmcFmodel implemented with 5 loci, 10 alleles/locus
  on a reactangle domain, on a longer MCMC run

* Character strings for path to the various files now declared in
  Fortran as character*256 instead of character*200

* Remove declaration of useless matrix s in PostProcessChain

* Additional functionality in PostProcessChain:
now  also computes posterior probabilities of population membership 
for individuals and writes them in file named proba.pop.membership.indiv.txt" 
The modal population for individual is written in a file named 
"modal.pop.indiv.txt"
