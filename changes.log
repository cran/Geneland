Changes from version 0.5:

* path.mcmc not written any longer in parameter file parameter.txt
(in order to avoid issues with path containing spaces).

* transform input data (coordinates, genotypes and allele.numbers)
  into matrices 
(to avoid issues with data frames).

* warning message of setplot function avoided by replacing last
instruction return (xlim, ylim, oldpin, newpin) by 
list(xlim, ylim, oldpin, newpin).

* carriage return after the tenth column in files 
  proba.pop.membership.txt and proba.pop.membership.perm.txt removed
  (now correct writing with up to thousand populations).

* path.mcmc now set as paste(tempdir(),"/",sep="") in the example of mcmcFmodel
